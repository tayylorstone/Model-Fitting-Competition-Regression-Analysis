Madrid Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to build a reliable model for predicting the sale price per square meter of residential properties in Madrid. Using a dataset of ~1,000 observations and 35 predictors describing property characteristics, surroundings, and district-level attributes, the model identifies key factors that influence housing values and evaluates predictive performance on unseen data.

The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modeling, focusing on metrics such as Adjusted R², AIC, and RMSE to balance accuracy and interpretability. Through variable refinement, interaction terms, and diagnostics, the model highlights the most influential attributes affecting housing prices across the city.

Results reveal that location, building features, and neighborhood characteristics are major drivers of price variation. Districts such as Salamanca, Centro, and Retiro command higher prices due to centrality and socioeconomic status, while more affordable areas like Moratalaz, Vallecas, and Carabanchel cater to middle- and lower-income families. Proximity to the M-30 ring road, availability of amenities (e.g., elevators, commercial areas), and environmental quality also significantly shape property values.

By integrating data analytics with socioeconomic context, this project not only delivers a predictive model with strong performance but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors that define Madrid’s real estate landscape.
